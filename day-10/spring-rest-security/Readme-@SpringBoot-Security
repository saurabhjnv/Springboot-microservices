Using the @RestController Annotation
------------------------------------

Spring 4.0 introduced @RestController, a specialized version of the controller which is a convenience 
annotation that does nothing more than add the @Controller and @ResponseBody annotations. 

By annotating the controller class with @RestController annotation, we no longer need to add @ResponseBody
to all the request mapping methods. 

The @ResponseBody annotation is active by default.



Spring 4.3 onwards:
------------------


@GetMapping is a composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for 
@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)


@PostMapping is a composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for 
@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)


@PutMapping is a composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for 
@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.PUT)


@DeleteMapping is a composed annotation that acts as a shortcut for
 @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.DELETE)
